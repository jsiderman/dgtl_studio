                            <p>Gazoozle is a college-centric marketing and ad agency that was in its startup phase when I joined. I was brought in to get the ball-rolling on their web presence, while developing a website for Gazoozle as well as web assets for their clients. Some of these clients included (but not limited to) Columbia Pictures (22 Jump Street), Made Eyewear, and BPong.</p>
